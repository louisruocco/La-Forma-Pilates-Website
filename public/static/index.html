                Ciao, my name is Rachel Muldoon, it’s lovely to meet you.
                My life has always been based on movement and I’m excited about sharing my passion with you. A professional dancer in theatre, TV and film, I have trained my whole life with Pilates intertwined from the age of ten. After suffering an injury in 2009 I used my time off to turn my constant support of Pilates into a career and studied with Body Control Pilates. 
                Since then I have shared my knowledge and experience for classes, injury rehab and performance enhancement. 
                Every ‘body’ is different and together we can explore movement that suits you to enhance and enjoy your training.
            </p>
